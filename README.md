## Fantasy Football Hub

Initially just going to be a landing page for members of my fantasy football league. Additional features that I would like to include goes as follows:

- League member info
- League Constitution (rules)
- Other league rules
- League Bets
- League Achievements
- League member stats
- And much, much more

### Obviously this will all be behind good 'ol OAuth. Not that I don't trust you. Yeah, you who is reading this. I mean, I could just be talking to myself because I'm not that cool of a dude to where people I don't know would be reading this...
